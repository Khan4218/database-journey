# 🗄️ Database Journey

Welcome to my **Database Journey** — a hands-on exploration of databases and SQL fundamentals.  
This repository tracks my progress as I learn how to design, query, and manage data effectively using real examples and practice exercises.

---

## 🎯 Goal
The purpose of this project is to **build a solid foundation in database concepts** through consistent, practical learning.  
Each commit represents a focused step in my learning process — from writing simple `SELECT` queries to mastering clauses like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN`.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Core SQL commands: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `LIMIT`
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data with real query examples  
- Understanding how relational databases organize and store information  
- Writing clean, well-commented SQL for readability and reusability  

---

## 🪄 Why This Matters
This project shows my **genuine learning process** — not copied content.  
Every commit reflects the actual steps I took while studying and practicing databases.  
It demonstrates how I approach learning by building, experimenting, and improving with each iteration.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **SQL** — Core query language for data manipulation  
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL** (conceptual focus)  
- **VS Code** for writing and testing queries

## 📘 About This Project
I created this repository as part of my continuous journey to become a stronger full-stack engineer with a deeper understanding of data systems.  
It’s meant to be a transparent record of growth — not perfection — and a space for exploring new database concepts step by step.

_If you’re reading this as a recruiter or collaborator — this repository is 100% my own work, built gradually and intentionally to strengthen my understanding of databases._
